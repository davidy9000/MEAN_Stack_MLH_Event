# Emojifier

## Technologies used in this project

## NodeJS

Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices. NodeJS was the platform in which we built this application.

### NPM packages used

#### [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)

Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for node. This is the framework with which we built the application.

#### [body-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser)

Is a Node.js body parsing middleware, it parses incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers. We used it to parse the body content of the request.

#### [cors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors)

CORS is a node.js package for providing a Connect/Express middleware that can be used to enable CORS with various options.

#### [request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request)

Request is designed to be the simplest way possible to make HTTP calls. It supports HTTPS and follows redirects by default.
